> Given balls *n\*n* balls of n colors with a random color distribution.

> Decide if possible and present the algorithm with which the balls were distributed into groups containing n groups of n balls, each containing a maximum of *2* colors. Groups of *one* color are also permitted.

The problem at hand doesn't have to be implemented with a single purpose. 
This can be abstracted to a set of n object with a set of specific attributes.
Since the objects do not have to be identified individually the concept can be abstracted.
For this reason this repository will contain only the ball distribution logic.
